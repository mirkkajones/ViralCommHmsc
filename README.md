# **ViralCommHmsc**

This repository accompanies the manuscript **"The first arriving virus shapes within-host viral community assembly during natural epidemics"** by Maija Jokinen et al. and provides the R scripts and their initial input data that are required to reproduce the manuscript's Hmsc joint species distributional modelling results.
   		  
**Disclaimer**: The code in this repository may still undergo revisions.
