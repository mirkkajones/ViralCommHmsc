# **ViralCommHmsc**

This repository will accompany the manuscript **"The first arriving virus shapes within-host viral community assembly during natural epidemics"** by Jokinen et al. and will eventually provide all R scripts and data required to reproduce the manuscript's results.
   		  
   		  
**Disclaimer**: The code in this repository represents a work in progress and may still undergo revisions.

**Authors**: The scripts were adapted by Mirkka Jones from Hmsc course scripts written by Hmsc-developers Otso Ovaskainen, Jari Oksanen, and others, of which later versions are available at https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/statistical-ecology/software/hmsc
