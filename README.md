# **ViralCommHmsc**

This repository will accompany the manuscript **"The first arriving virus shapes within-host viral community assembly during natural epidemics"** by Jokinen et al. and will eventually provide all R scripts and data required to reproduce the manuscript's results.
   		  
   		  
**Disclaimer**: The code in this repository represents a work in progress and may still undergo revisions.

**Authors**: The scripts were developed in a collaboration between Otso Ovaskainen and Mirkka Jones and are based on use of the Hmsc R package.
